## üìù Project Overview

Mario Kart in real-life? That's basically what we did. We designed a boost system similar to those in Mario Kart, where detecting colored pieces of paper on the track can change throttle for a short period of time. Depending on the color of the "pad" the car drives over, it will either speed up, slow down, or stop for a few seconds, just like in the game!

## üçÑ Final Project

### What We Promised

#### Must haves
[X] Distinguishing different colors through the camera
[X] Adjust the throttle based on the color

#### Nice to haves
[X] Have the car detect a flat piece of paper on the track (like a booster pad)
[ ] Combine with lane-following algorithm

### What We Accomplished

#### Color Detection
- Used OpenCV for color detection and edge tracing
- Used color mask algorithm to detect proportion of frame that color takes up
- Detected multiple colors at the same time
- Determined HSVs for orange, pink, and blue

#### PyVESC
- Connection through external webcam
- Different RPM values are sent through PyVesc to achieve different speed for different colors marked by different states:
  - Blue (Boost) = speed up for 3 sec
  - Pink (Slow)= slow down for 3 sec
  - Orange (Stop) = stop for 3 sec
  - Neutral (Normal) = constant rpm

### Code

### Possible Future Work
- Change the colored paper into Mario Kart items (mushroom, bananas, etc.) for the car to identify
- Allow the car to run autonomously on a track and still apply speed changes
- Race with other teams üòâ
