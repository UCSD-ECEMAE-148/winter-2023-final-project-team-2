## üèé Project Overview

Mario Kart in real-life? That's basically what we did. We designed a boost system similar to those in Mario Kart, where detecting colored pieces of paper on the track can change throttle for a short period of time. Depending on the color of the "pad" the car drives over, it will either speed up, slow down, or stop for a few seconds, just like in the game!
